# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage was created to be a waypoint for fledgling developers by providing simple, straight-to-the-point information on the most widely used tools in software development. This webpage is aimed to make it easier for learners to keep track of information and provide simple examples of some of the languages in use. This project has taught me how far you can go with the fundementals of programming, with such minimal knowledge.

## Usage

Each section of the webpage contains some notes to help you get familiar with topics of programming. These being HTML, CSS, Git/CLI, and Javascript. The information listed in each section will provide clarity about certain tools within these topics and also help learners keep track of certain commands and what they do. 

If the user opens the console of the webpage, they will find Javascript code running, that lists off the topics and chooses a topic to study at random every time the page is refreshed.
