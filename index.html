        <ul>

          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage, including the title and metadata</li>
          
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

          <li> HTML is the framework of a website.</li>

          <li>!DOCTYPE tells the browser what code it should expect to recieve. Doctype is not case sensitive. </li>

          <li>Tags are what is within the '< >' signs, elements are the whole thing.</li>

          <li>Semantic elements are tags that have no effect on the webpage, they are just used for organization. Like main, header, body and section </li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The terminology and formatting for css rule goes as such: selector{property: value} and the whole thing is referred to as a "declaration"</li>
          <li>When entering property values that style the top, bottom, left, and right; two values can be set, the first defining top and bottom, the other defining left and right. </li>
          <li>Setting "auto" to sizing declarations will auto set the value of the size to what fits the webpage or div.</li>

        <h2>Git and CLI</h2>

        <h3>Git</h3>

        <ul>

          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently working on</li>

          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>

          <li>git cd: changes the directory the computer works under. "git cd .." will go backwards.</li>

          <li>git add -A: add command will add modifications in the current working branch to the staging area. The -A glag indicates that we want to add all changes. (The staging area informs git that the changes will be added in the next commit.) </li>

          <li>git commit -m "title": commits currently staged changes with a title that describes the changes </li>

          <li>git pull origin main: good practice to double check if local branch is in sync with the remote base branch in GitHub. pull recieves a branch's modifications into the local environment. origin indicates the source of the pull will be in the GitHub repo. main indicates the branch.</li>

          <li>git push origin branch: push will push the local changes to the remote GitHub branch.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>CLI</h3>

        <ul>

          <li>code . : opens up code editor</li>

          <li>pwd: displays the current working directory</li>

          <li>ls: displays list of files and folders in the current directory</li>

          <li>mkdir: creates directory</li>

          <li>touch: creates file inside directory</li>
